### Project Overview
This project is a Java-based application that demonstrates the functionality of three classes: `Account`, `Date`, and `Time`. The project also includes corresponding test classes to verify the correctness of each class.

The project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and is organized into the following packages:
- `Account`: Handles bank account operations.
- `Date`: Manages dates and date-related functionality.
- `Time`: Manages time operations such as incrementing and decrementing time.

### Project Structure

# Account Package
- Account.java: Defines an `Account` class that represents a bank account. It includes methods for crediting, debiting, and transferring money between accounts.
- TestAccount.java**: A test class that demonstrates how to use the `Account` class, including creating accounts, transferring funds, and checking balances.

# Date Package
- Date.java: Manages dates with methods to get, set, and format the day, month, and year.
- TestDate.java: A test class that demonstrates how to create and modify `Date` objects.

# Time Package
- Time.java**: Manages time, allowing for the increment and decrement of seconds, as well as formatting time in `hh:mm:ss`.
- **TestTime.java**: A test class that demonstrates how to use the `Time` class by incrementing and decrementing time.
